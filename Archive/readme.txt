Great question 👍 Let’s walk through running your build-and-backup.js step by step:

🛠️ 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

Node.js (version 18+ recommended)
👉 Download Node.js

Check it:

node -v
npm -v

📂 2. Create a working folder
mkdir ehouse-builder
cd ehouse-builder

📄 3. Save the script

Inside ehouse-builder/, create a file:

build-and-backup.js

Paste the full code (all Parts 1–6 combined in order).

Also place your logo file in the same folder, named exactly:

logo.png

📦 4. Install dependencies
npm init -y
npm install archiver


Optional: You’ll later also run the React project, so install these too:

npm install react react-dom vite @vitejs/plugin-react tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer lucide-react jspdf file-saver

▶️ 5. Run the generator script
node build-and-backup.js


If all good, you’ll see ✅ messages like:

✅ Wrote e-house-configurator/package.json
✅ Wrote e-house-configurator/src/App.jsx
...
📦 Backup complete: 102400 bytes
➡️ Archive ready at: /your/path/ehouse-builder/e-house-configurator-backup.zip

📂 6. Open the project

Now you have two things:

e-house-configurator/ → full project source code

e-house-configurator-backup.zip → compressed archive

Go inside the generated project:

cd e-house-configurator

💻 7. Run the configurator locally

Initialize Tailwind:

npx tailwindcss init -p


Start the dev server:

npm run dev


Visit the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173
) and you’ll see your E-House Configurator with role selection, dashboards, exports, etc.

⚡ That’s it!
