# 🛑 E-House Configurator Project – Action Stage Checkpoint

## 📍 Current Stage
We are at the point where:
- A **self-bootstrapping generator script** (`create-e-house-configurator-package.js`) has been written.  
- This script does the following:
  1. Creates **all Markdown docs** with finalized content.  
  2. Generates **PDFs** for each doc using Puppeteer.  
  3. Creates a fresh **React + Vite scaffold** inside `e-house-configurator/`.  
  4. Saves **build-and-backup.js** (fresh version).  
  5. Runs build-and-backup.js immediately to produce `e-house-configurator-backup.zip`.  
  6. Packages everything into **`e-house-configurator-package.zip`**.  

## 📂 Output Structure After Running Once


e-house-configurator-package/
├── docs/.md (Markdown docs)
├── docs/.pdf (PDFs generated from docs)
├── build-and-backup.js
├── e-house-configurator/ (React + Vite scaffold)
├── e-house-configurator-backup.zip
├── README.md
└── e-house-configurator-package.zip

## ⚙️ Dependencies Installed
```bash
npm install puppeteer archiver

📝 Next Optional Step

We paused here.
The next step (if resuming) is to optionally add Vite configs (vite.config.js, index.html) so that the scaffolded app can run immediately with npm run dev.

✅ Resume Instruction

When this file is uploaded back into ChatGPT, continue from:
“Insert Vite configs into scaffold so the generated app runs immediately.”

## 📂 Pending Integration
The following Vite configs need to be included in the scaffold:

- `vite.config.js`  
- `index.html`  
- `src/main.jsx`

Once these files are added, the generated app will run directly with:

```bash
cd e-house-configurator
npm install
npm run dev
